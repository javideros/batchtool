# Screen Guide üñ•Ô∏è

> Let's walk through each screen - no jargon, just the good stuff!

## The Main Journey üõ§Ô∏è

### 1. Batch Details - "Tell Us About Your Job" üìù

This is where it all starts! Think of it as filling out a job application for your batch process.

**What you'll fill out:**
- **Job Name** - Something memorable (like "daily_sales_report")
- **What Department** - Which team owns this? (Eligibility, Finance, etc.)
- **How Often** - Daily? Weekly? You decide!
- **Java Package** - Where your code will live (like "com.company.batch")

**Don't worry, we'll catch mistakes:**
- Can't leave anything blank
- Job names must be unique (no duplicates!)
- Package names need to look like real Java packages

---

### 2. Batch Properties - "Job Settings" ‚öôÔ∏è

Think of this like setting up preferences for your job. Need a timeout? A retry count? This is the place!

**Cool features:**
- **Add as many as you want** - Click the "+" button to add more
- **Pick the right type** - String, Number, Boolean, or Date
- **We give you one free** - `asOfDate` is already there (system handles it)

**We'll keep you on track:**
- No duplicate names allowed
- Every property needs a name AND value
- Values should match their type (numbers look like numbers, etc.)

---

### 3. Batch Listeners - "Who's Watching?" üëÇ

Want to know when your job starts, finishes, or hits a snag? Listeners are your friends!

**What's neat:**
- **Add multiple listeners** - The more the merrier
- **Smart suggestions** - We'll suggest names based on your package
- **Java-friendly** - Must end with 'Listener' (we'll remind you)

**We'll help you avoid oops moments:**
- Class names must look like real Java classes
- No two listeners can have the same name
- Package structure needs to make sense

---

### 4. Dynamic Steps - "The Fun Part!" üéØ

This is where you decide what your job actually DOES. It's like choosing your adventure!

**Pick your style:**
- **Batchlet** - "Just run this one thing" (simple and sweet)
- **Chunk** - "Read some data, do stuff to it, write it out" (the classic)
- **Chunk + Partition** - "Same as chunk, but run multiple copies in parallel" (for speed demons)

**What makes it special:**
- **Smart step names** - lowercase_with_underscores (we'll enforce this)
- **Optional processor** - For chunks, you can skip the middle step if you want
- **Adaptive flow** - We'll show you exactly the right screens based on your choice

---

### 5. Summary - "Does This Look Right?" üîç

The grand finale! This is your chance to review everything before calling it done.

**You'll see:**
- **Your job basics** - Name, schedule, all that good stuff
- **All your properties** - With their types clearly marked
- **Your listeners** - Both job-level and step-level
- **Step details** - Every class, every setting, everything

**Your options:**
- **Go back** - Spotted a typo? No problem!
- **Finish up** - Looks good? Hit that complete button! üéâ
